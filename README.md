sandbox-php
===========

Just a sandbox repository of snippets as I play with PHP. *Nothing to see here.*

In this repository, you will find:
* basic PHP coding from tutorials and books
* example snippets for WordPress projects
* excessively breaking things

What to expect?
---------------

In an effort to implement git into my day-to-day workflow, I am going to dedicated this repository to snippets of code that I create. I know that I could just use gist, however I am trying to get use to using git in the cli.

If you've stumbled upon this repository, you might be looking for example snippets for WordPress, WooThemes, or snippets for learning PHP. I will be committing example code as I read through PHP.

I feel that it's very important to implement projects and workflows in side projects that also apply to day-to-day work tasks. Off hours for me is spent on reading and learning. :)
