sandbox
===========

Just a sandbox repository of snippets as I play with PHP, JS, etc. *Nothing to see here.*

In this repository, you will find:
* basic JS/PHP coding from tutorials and books
* example snippets for WordPress projects
* excessively breaking things

Why A Sandbox Repository?
---------------
I enjoy developing locally and experimenting. I have a laptop, several desktops, and VM's where I play with code. I'm trying to force myself to use git daily, so this is a place I can play and keep the code in case I'm out with my laptop.
